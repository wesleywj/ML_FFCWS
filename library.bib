  abstract = {This study examined the relationship between life satisfaction and physical status, emotional health, social support and locus of control in the frail elderly. A random sample of 99 low-income, frail elderly living in the community was interviewed. Almost 40\% of participants reported high levels of life satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis identified four significant predictors of life satisfaction: Perceived physical health, social support, emotional balance, and locus of control. Physical health emerged as the most significant predictor of life satisfaction accounting for 14\% of the variance. Social support, emotional balance and locus of control each accounted for an additional 6\% of the variance in life satisfaction. All four predictors explained 32\% (R= .57) of the total variance in life satisfaction. Implications for practice and recommendations are discussed.},

The literatures on education and income mobility reveal a similar ranking with South America, other developing nations, southern European countries and France tending to have rather limited mobility although the Nordic countries exhibit strong mobility. Estimates of mobility based on social class point to rather different patterns, and we demonstrate that these differences are most likely generated by intergenerational earnings persistence within social classes. The second part of the paper looks for explanations for the differences in earnings and education persistence and finds that mobility is negatively correlated with inequality and the return to education but positively correlated with a nation's education spending.},

  abstract = {The trends in the gender pay gap in the United States form a somewhat mixed picture. On the one hand, after a half a century of stability in the earnings of women relative to men, there has been a substantial increase in women's relative earnings since the late 1970s. One of the things that make this development especially dramatic and significant is that the recent changes contrast markedly with the relative stability of earlier years. On the other hand, there is still a gender pay gap. Women continue to earn considerably less than men on average, and the convergence that began in the late 1970s slowed noticeably in the 1990s. Is this slowdown just a blip in an overall trend, or has the pay gap converged as far as it can? We look at this issue in depth and make some predictions for the future.}

  abstract = {IntroductionIn the broad project of “class analysis” a great deal of effort goes into defining class and delineating the boundaries of classes. This is necessarily so, because class analysis is “the empirical investigation of the consequences and corollaries of the existence of a class structure defined ex-ante” (Breen and Rottman 1995b, p. 453). By starting from a particular definition, sociologists can assess the extent to which such things as inequality in life chances among individuals and families are structured on the basis of class. This approach stands in contrast to one that discovers a class structure from the empirical distribution of inequality in society (Sørensen 2000 labels this the “nominal classifications” approach). In class analysis the theoretical underpinnings of the version of class that is being used have to be made clear at the outset, and the concept of class has to be operationalized so as to allow claims about class to be tested empirically. If we examine the two main varieties of contemporary class analysis – namely Marxist class analysis, particularly associated with the work of Erik Olin Wright and his associates, and the neo-Weberian class analysis linked to the use of the class schema devised by John Goldthorpe – we find that these two tasks are central to both.In this chapter I will discuss some of the issues involved in seeking to pursue class analysis within a broadly Weberian perspective.},

More specifically, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that analyzes how income inequality interacts with individuals’ income position in explaining citizens’ involvement in conventional and unconventional political activities. The core of the paper focuses on a multilevel mixed-effects empirical analysis carried out on survey data collected by the European Values Study project; its results support the hypothesis that income inequality significantly shapes the effect of household income in determining citizens’ forms of political engagement.},

Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of SWB that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing SWB, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of SWB (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).

  abstract = {This paper presents an empirical analysis of the importance of ‘comparison income’ for individual well-being or happiness. In other words, the influence of the income of a reference group on individual well-being is examined. The main novelty is that various hypotheses are tested: the importance of the own income, the relevance of the income of the reference group and of the distance between the own income and the income of the reference group, and most importantly the asymmetry of comparisons, i.e. the comparison income effect differing between rich and poor individuals. The analysis uses a self-reported measure of satisfaction with life as a measure of individual well-being. The data come from a large German panel known as GSOEP. The study concludes that the income of the reference group is about as important as the own income for individual happiness, that individuals are happier the larger their income is in comparison with the income of the reference group, and that for West Germany this comparison effect is asymmetric. This final result supports Dusenberry's idea that comparisons are mostly upwards.},

Research on this topic has focused mainly on unequal participation in the United States and we know little about contemporary patterns in other contexts. This article uses data from the European Social Survey to explore the effect of various possible sources of inequality (gender, age, social class, education, income, ethnicity, and working status) on four political activities: voting, working with parties and action groups, attending demonstrations, and boycotting products. Overall, age, education, and social class emerge as the most common causes of distortion, while gender, membership in minorities, and occupational variables are less clearly related to participation. In conventional political activities the differences are more predictable in the direction of the disadvantaged, while demonstrators are in some respects undistinguishable from the general public. Finally, the fact that socioeconomic inequalities in turnout are unambiguously visible in most European countries stands in contrast to past research and deserves further attention.}

However, it is becoming a controversial topic. Indeed, dependent on approach, LS is either considered a cause (top-down) or an effect (bottom-up). The aim of the present study was to investigate both cross-lagged and simultaneous effects between LS (as an enduring component of SWB) and physical health (as measured by self-perceived health and self-reported diseases), using 8-year longitudinal data from a sample of older adults. Method: The study included 899 participants aged 64 to 97 years and assessed 5 times over an 8-year period. Cross-lagged and simultaneous models were specified and estimated using structural equation modeling. Results: Both cross-lagged and simultaneous coefficients indicated that poor health significantly predicted subsequent levels of life dissatisfaction, but LS did not predict subsequent levels of health. Conclusions: These findings contradict, at least in our older sample, the postulates of positive psychology, and support the bottom-up approach to well-being as well as the popular adage, “As long as you’ve got your health.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

To do so, we utilize European Social Survey waves 1 to 5 (2002–2010) and obtain information on life satisfaction as well as destination and origin class for about 80,000 respondents in 32 European countries. We find (i) class destination consistently and strongly structures life satisfaction across Europe, (ii) own class mobility has a significant impact on life satisfaction in Eastern Europe, as does (iii) the class mobility of others. The last finding points to the hitherto neglected importance of reference effects when considering the impact of social class on life satisfaction.},

  abstract = {RÉSUMÉ Cet article explore la satisfaction de la vie de 81 personnes âgées, sélectionnées au hasard (58 femmes et 23 hommes; âge moyen 76), d'origine chinoise et provenant de l'ouest du Canada. La variable dépendante, la satisfaction de la vie, a été mesurée en utilisant le «Life Satisfaction Index-A (LSI-A)» et une mesure globale à une seule question. Les résultats ont indiqué que la plupart des personnes âgées, immigrants d'origine chinoise faisant partie de cette étude, étaient plutôt satisfaites de leur vie et ont obtenu des résultats élevés en utilisant la mesure LSI-A. Niveau d'activité, santé psychologique, supports sociaux, amour propre, et le sens d'être en charge d'eux-mêmes étaient significativement associés avec les deux mesures de satisfaction. L'analyse de regression multiple révèle que la santé psychologique, le soutien social et le sens d'être en charge d'eux-mêmes étaient les meilleurs prédicteurs. Concernant la satisfaction de la vie, tant pour hommes que pour les femmes, il n'y avait pour ainsi dire aucune différence. D'autres analyses ont examinés les corrélate de la satisfaction de la vie des répondants des deux sexes. Les moyens d'améliorer la satisfaction de la vie de cette minorité ethnique sont le point d'intérêt de la discussion.},

  abstract = {The social assistance and subjective well-being literature frequently shows “stigma” and “disempowerment” effects accompanying government transfers. These studies posit that the bureaucratic processes of government income assistance programs generate feelings of shame among recipients and adversely impacts their self-assessed well-being; or that being the “passive recipient” of state assistance undermines an individual’s sense of empowerment. We examine whether this theory holds under conditions of instability and conflict. In Iraq, with a recent history of violent conflict and everyday uncertainties, public transfers may play a crucial role in the very survival of Iraqi citizens, and thus strongly predict subjective well-being. Similarly, other sources of income, such as remittances and self-generated income from employment and personal assets, could have positive effects on the self-assessed well-being of Iraqis. Based on the 2012 Iraq Household Survey data, our empirical investigation finds that the source of income and the way in which income is generated matters to individuals, even in situations of extreme economic and political uncertainty. Individuals derive greater satisfaction from public assistance programs and income generation processes that emphasize self-reliance and independence.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the extent to which there is an intergenerational transmission of mental health and subjective well-being within families. Specifically it asks whether parents' own mental distress influences their child's life satisfaction, and vice versa. Whilst the evidence on daily contagion of stress and strain between members of the same family is substantial, the evidence on the transmission between parental distress and children's well-being over a longer period of time is sparse. We tested this idea by examining the within-family transmission of mental distress from parent to child's life satisfaction, and vice versa, using rich longitudinal data on 1,175 British youths. Results show that parental distress at year t – 1 is an important determinant of child's life satisfaction in the current year. This is true for boys and girls, although boys do not appear to be affected by maternal distress levels. The results also indicated that the child's own life satisfaction is related with their father's distress levels in the following year, regardless of the gender of the child. Finally, we examined whether the underlying transmission correlation is due to shared social environment, empathic reactions, or transmission via parent–child interaction.}

We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the key normative issues raised by empirical research into social mobility and meritocracy. Typically, sociologists working in this area are motivated by a concern with matters of social justice and equality of opportunity, but that concern tends to be rather vague and diffuse, which makes it difficult to assess the normative relevance of their findings. Surveying, in an accessible manner, five issues familiar to political philosophers that clarify the significance of sociologists' results, this paper explains why a regime of 'perfect mobility' is not an appropriate benchmark for evaluating the extent to which a society offers its members social justice or equality of opportunity. Some of the mechanisms that produce an association between the social position of parents and children are unobjectionable and would exist even in an altogether just society. Sociologists do not endorse perfect mobility. But neither are they clear about the variety, and normative significance, of the various mechanisms that tend to generate inequalities in mobility chances.}

The harmful features of some jobs are also those which cause deterioration in unemployment, and the factors which are beneficial in jobs can also enhance mental health during unemployment.  The framework to be developed has three major parts. The first two are what McGuire (1983) has described as "categorical" and "process" theories.  The third part of the overall framework addresses the interaction between persons and situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Class differences in support for parties of the left and right have usually been seen as a direct consequence of interests in income redistribution. The authors examine intervening variables that might explain the relation between class and vote, including attitudes toward redistribution and other economic issues and beliefs about the parties' concern with social classes and other groups. Controlling for these variables does not eliminate the direct effects of class. Some evidence is found that social influences may affect vote directly without operating through attitudes, as suggested by the Columbia voting studies and also that voters do not use the same standards in evaluating the parties, contrary to the assumptions of the prevailing spatial model. Substantial revisions are necessary if rational choice theory, as conventionally understood, is to account for class voting.},

Referring to the so-called Easterlin paradox, three mechanisms are discussed: basic human need satisfaction, interpersonal comparison processes, and adaptation. Hypotheses resulting from these considerations are empirically tested on the basis of two data sets: a self conducted cross-sectional survey among the population of Munich and GSOEP panel data. In result, all three mechanisms prove of explanatory value. According to our estimates, the threshold for fulfillment of basic needs lies within the range of ∼800 euros disposable income per month in Germany. We also provide weak evidence for social comparison processes concerning the respondents’ city district. More importantly, using a new measurement method for social comparisons, we show life-satisfaction-relevant comparison processes for colleagues and average citizens, but not for friends and relatives. Furthermore, using panel data we confirm hypotheses of aspiration and adaptation. Thus, relative income (social as well as temporal) is more important for life satisfaction than absolute income. Moreover, as theoretically expected, income losses have a stronger influence on life satisfaction than income gains—a finding which can also be transferred to social comparisons.},
